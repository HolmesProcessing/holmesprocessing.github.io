##### Overview
Just like Holmes-Totem the "Dynamic" Planner is responsible for turning data into information by performing feature extraction against submitted objects. When tasked, Holmes-Totem-Dynamic schedules the execution of its services which are focused on dynamic and other long or indefinite running analysis tasks. 


##### Highlights

###### Inner workings

Totem-Dynamic is based on [distributed_cuckoo](https://github.com/cynexit/cuckoo_distributed) and uses a similar concept. Just like Totem it accepts incoming tasks via AMQP and sends the results back via AMQP as soon as they are availible.
Internally the application is mostly devided in three parts. `feed` is accepting new tasks from the outside, checks the status of the requested service and - if everything is fine - submits the task to the service or else postpones it until the service status is good again.  `check` then periodically checks if the service is done with the task or if it still need time or if an error occured. `submit` then collects the results from the service and sends it out
