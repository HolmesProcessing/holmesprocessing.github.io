##### Overview
The Holmes-Totem Planner is responsible for turning data into information by performing feature extraction against submitted objects. When tasked, Holmes-Totem schedules the execution of its Services which are capable of performing static and dynamic analysis as well as gather data from third parties.

The Holmes-Totem Investigation Planner is optimized for executing extraction Services that complete in a few seconds, i.e. static analysis and 3rd party queries. When dealing with Services that take longer to complete, we recommend pairing the Holmes-Totem Planner with [Holmes-Totem-Dynamic](https://github.com/HolmesProcessing/Holmes-Totem-Dynamic)
